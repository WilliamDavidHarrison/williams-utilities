# William's Utilities
Discord Utility Bot

This bot is currently a private bot, but I might make it public in the future.

## Planned Features

```
API so no need for the main config files.
More image commands.
Proper website hosting with the API supplying latency, guild, user info.
Move more IDs and values to .env
```

## Notes
Some command folders are empty which GitHub doesn't allow, so GitHub doesn't upload them, but without them the bot may crash. If this happens please add the following folders: "src/slashcommands/moderation" and "src/slashcommands/owner". This will be fixed in the future.

If you recieve any further errors, please [contact me](mailto:william@williamharrison.dev).

The database must be a MongoDB database for the bot to work correctly.

You can get a Memer API token [here](https://memer-api.js.org).
