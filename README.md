# William's Utilities
Discord Utility Bot

## Website
https://bot.williamharrison.dev

## API
Coming Soon | https://api.bot.williamharrison.dev

## Notes
Some folders are empty which GitHub doesn't allow, so GitHub deletes them, but without them the bot may crash.
If this happens, please [contact me](mailto:william@williamharrison.dev).

The database must be MongoDB to work correctly.

You can get a Memer API token [here](http://memer-api.js.org/).
