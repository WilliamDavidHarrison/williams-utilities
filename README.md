# William's Utilities
Discord Utility Bot

This bot is currently a private bot, but I might make it public in the future.

## Planned Features

```
Create an API so then there is no need for the main config files
More image commands
Proper website hosting with the API supplying values.
Move more IDs and values to .env
```

## Notes
Some command folders are empty which GitHub doesn't allow, so GitHub doesn't upload them, but without them the bot may crash. If this happens please add the following folders: "src/slashcommands/moderation" and "src/slashcommands/owner". This will be fixed in the future.

If you recieve any further errors, please [contact me](mailto:william@williamharrison.dev).

The database must be a MongoDB database for the bot to work correctly.

You can get a Memer API token [here](https://memer-api.js.org).
