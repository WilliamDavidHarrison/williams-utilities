# William's Utilities
Discord Utility Bot

This bot is currently a private bot, but I might make it public in the future or create a seperate bot with the similar features but more flexibility.

## Website
https://bot.williamharrison.dev

## Planned Features

```
API so no need for the main config files.
More image commands.
Proper website hosting with the API supplying latency, guild, user info.
```

## Notes
Some folders are empty which GitHub doesn't allow, so GitHub deletes them, but without them the bot may crash.
If this happens, please [contact me](mailto:william@williamharrison.dev).

The Bot [Dashboard](https://bot.williamharrison.dev) is hosted on the bot.

The database must be MongoDB to work correctly.

You can get a Memer API token [here](https://memer-api.js.org/).
